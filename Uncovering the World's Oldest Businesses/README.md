It leverages data on the oldest companies still in operation around the world, compiled by BusinessFinancing.co.uk.

## Analysis Goals:

This dataset can be used to answer various questions about long-lasting businesses, such as:

What is the oldest business on each continent?

How many countries per continent lack data on the oldest businesses? (Considering both existing businesses and potentially new businesses)

Which business categories are best suited to last many years, and on what continent are they?
